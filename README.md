# SwiperApp
Android Application to test and improve user's texting/typing speed on a smartphone


SwiperApp is an Android Application that tests users typing speed in words per minute(wpm). Its basically a game which actually improves users typing speed on a smartphone, with constant practice. 
SwiperApp has two modes-Paragraph Mode and Boost Mode. In Paragraph Mode, A random paragraph from a list of pre-Stored Paragraphs is selected and displayed for the user to type. In Boost mode random words appear one by one for the user to type. In Both these modes, a countdown timer has been added. Finally, the results give the typing speed of the player in wpm.
Weve also implemented networking concepts by adding Multiplayer mode in which 2 players compete against each other in real Time. Bluetooth has been incorporated to facilitate the networking needs of the application.
